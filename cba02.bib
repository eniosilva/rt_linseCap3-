The narrowbandinput signal is classified into a limited number of speech sounds(HMM states) for which the wideband spectral envelope is estimatedusing the pre-trained model. The enhanced speech exhibits a significantly improved quality without objectionable artifacts.},

  abstract = {The restricted audio quality of today's telephone networks is mainly due to the narrowband (NB) limitation to the frequency range from about 300 Hz to 3.4 kHz. Meanwhile, codecs for wideband (WB) telephony (50 Hz to 7 kHz) exist with significantly improved speech intelligibility and naturalness. However, the broad introduction of wideband speech coding will require strong efforts of both network operators and their customers because many elements of the networks (i.e., terminals and network nodes) have to be modified. An intermediate step to overcome the narrowband limitation can be achieved by applying artificial bandwidth extension (BWE) in the receiver. In this article we review the basic principles of bandwidth extension, and discuss several application scenarios in which both wideband coding and BWE complement each other. The introduction of BWE methods in terminals and networks may help to speed up the introduction of true wideband speech coding in the near future.},

G.729.1 can operate at 12 different bit rates from 32 down to 8 kbit/s with wideband quality starting at 14 kbit/s. This coder is a bitstream interoperable extension of ITU-T G.729 based on three embedded stages: narrowband cascaded CELP coding at 8 and 12 kbit/s, time-domain bandwidth extension (TDBWE) at 14 kbit/s, and split-band MDCT coding with spherical vector quantization (VQ) and pre-echo reduction from 16 to 32 kbit/s. Side information - consisting of signal class, phase, and energy - is transmitted at 12, 14 and 16 kbit/s to improve the resilience and recovery of the decoder in case of frame erasures. The quality, delay, and complexity of G.729.1 are summarized based on ITU-T results},
